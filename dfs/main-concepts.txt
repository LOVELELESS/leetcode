Find cycle:
- Find back edges (i.e. when neighbor is visited AND in the stack)

Longest path in DAG:
- Toposort
- Relax edges in toposort order -> get max(dist(v))

Toposort:
- Prepend to list after processing all neighs of node

Articulation Bridge:
- Note down the start time of dfs-visit to each node
- Note down the loLink time (earliest startTime) by taking min of its children (except parent)
- (u->v) is bridge if start[u] < loLink[v]

Articulation Point:
- Similar to Articulation Bridge, but u is Articulation Point if for (u->v), start[u] <= loLink[v]

Strongly-Connected Components:
